# Convert 2D to 3D object  
Solidworks Software was used for this purpose because of the avability of specific tools.  
The example used here is Dallah.
Dallah is a traditional Arabic coffee pot used for centuries to brew and serve Arabic coffee. The task was oriented to enable the robot to serve coffee.  
The diffculity was that the robot hand was uncompatible with Dallah handle. 
The solution will be:
* Use Dallah figure to sketch suitable handle that fill the empty space.
* Convert that sketch to 3D object.
* Print it using 3D printer and fix it to robot.

## 1- Export the figure to Solidworks  
Use Sketch Picture tool to select the Dallah figure
